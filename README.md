**NOTE** Jemena no longer uses the electricity outlook software that this was originally built on. I'll leave this active in case the other distributors that could use this are still enabled for now.

Please see a new version created by @jonnynch @ [ha-jemenaoutlook](https://github.com/jonnynch/ha-jemenaoutlook) which integrates with the new portal Jemena are using [MyPortal](https://myportal.jemena.com.au/).
 
 # ha-jemenaoutlook

This is a [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) sensor component to retrieve information from the [Jemena Electricity Outlook](https://electricityoutlook.jemena.com.au/) website, they are an electricity distributor within Victoria, Australia.

This component will retrieve your electricity usage details from their website, and only cover a limited area around the northern and north western suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria.

To use this component you will need to register for an account via the Electricity Outlook website.

If Jemena are not your electricity distributor then this will be of no use to you.

The component will only retrieve Yesterdays usage, which will also retrieve the previous days if you wish do do some other comparisions. It could easily be extended to retrieve weekly, monthly or seasonal figures as well. (I haven't got that far yet)

The component is based on an older version of the [Hydro-Qu√©bec](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.hydroquebec/) energy sensor which is part fo the standard Home Assistant components. Thank you to the writer of that component it helpd a lot.

This component is not endorsed by Jemena, nor have a I asked for their endorsement.

## Installing the component

Copy the included files (except README.md) to it's own directory called jemenaoutlook within custom_components directory where the configuration for your installation of home assistant sits. 

The custom_components directory does not exist in default installation state and may need to be created.

```
<homeassistant-user-configuration-directory>/custom_components/jemenaoutlook/sensor.py
<homeassistant-user-configuration-directory>/custom_components/jemenaoutlook/__init__.py
<homeassistant-user-configuration-directory>/custom_components/jemenaoutlook/manifest.py
```
For me this is :-
```
/home/ha/.homeassistant/custom_components/jemenaoutlook/sensor.py
/home/ha/.homeassistant/custom_components/jemenaoutlook/__init__.py
/home/ha/.homeassistant/custom_components/jemenaoutlook/manifest.py
```

Or just use git to clone into a jemenaoutlook directory, when using this method make sure teh user home-assistant is running as can read these files.
```
git clone https://github.com/mvandersteen/ha-jemenaoutlook.git jemenaoutlook
```
